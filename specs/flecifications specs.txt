specs invaders

must support nested contexts
must support asynchronous method calls and events
must output readable results
must allow plain language test names

must allow pluggable runner
must allow pluggable reporter
must provide events / hooks to before, after, start describe, end describe, start it, end it
must provide stack trace filter to remove irrelevant portions of the file path

should provide an integration layer to flexunit

-- describe, it

when describe() is called
  it should be added to the examples in the current example group
  it should be set as the current example group
  it should run if no other example group is running
  it should be set to pending if another example group is running

when it() is called
  it should be added to the examples in the current example group
  it should run if no other example is running
  it should be set to pending if another example or example group is running

when an example group is run
  it should call the first pending example or example group
  
when an example is run
  it should be set to running
  it should evaluate its specifications
  it should accumulate async data, timeouts, etc
  it should wait until asyncs are invoked or async timeout occurs then be set to done

when an example is done
  it should call the next pending example or example group

-- given, when, then

when #given is called
  it should add the block to an examples preconditions

when #given is called, and then #and
  it should add the block to an examples preconditions

when #when is called
  it should add the block to an examples (event conditions | conditions | transition)

when #when is called, and then #and
  it should add the block to an examples (event conditions | conditions | transition)

when #then is called
  it should add the block to an examples assertions

when #then is called, and then #and
  it should add the block to an examples assertions
