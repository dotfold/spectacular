Spectacular

must support nested contexts
must support asynchronous method calls and events
must output readable results
must allow plain language spec/test/example names

must allow pluggable runner
must allow pluggable reporter
must provide events / hooks to before, after, start describe, end describe, start it, end it
must provide stack trace filter to remove irrelevant portions of the file path, etc

must run examples in order by default
must run examples out-of-order by request

must be able to rerun an example for use when debugging, tracing

dry run
  - run describes/ExampleGroups, not its/Examples
  
maybe spec runner could use a filterchain for separating execution, event dispatch, etc

-- describe, it
-- to be moved to runnable specs

when describe() is called
  it should be added to the examples in the current example group
  it should be set as the current example group
  it should run if no other example group is running
  it should be set to pending if another example group is running

when it() is called
  it should be added to the examples in the current example group
  it should run if no other example is running
  it should be set to pending if another example or example group is running

when an example group is run
  it should call the first pending example or example group
  
when an example is run
  it should be set to running
  it should evaluate its specifications
  it should accumulate async data, timeouts, etc
  it should wait until asyncs are invoked 
  it should fail if async timeout occurs 
  
when an example completes
  it should be set to done
  
when an example fails
  it should be set to done

when an example is done
  it should call the next pending example or example group
